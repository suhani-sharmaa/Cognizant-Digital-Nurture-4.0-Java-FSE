Exercise 7: Implementing Financial Forecasting

This project predicts the future value of an investment using both recursive and iterative methods in Java.

RecursiveForecast.java – Uses recursion to calculate future value.
IterativeForecast.java – Uses a loop (iteration) to calculate future value.
Main.java – Calls both methods and prints the results.
